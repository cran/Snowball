Generating a Snowball jar archive
---------------------------------
1. download the latest Java sources of Snowball
   http://snowball.tartarus.org/

2. create directory "src" in the same directory as the "build.xml"
   ant file.

3. unpack the contents of the downloaded archive and move the 
   sub-directory "org" (beneath "libstemmer/java/") into the "src"
   folder.

4. run "ant patch" to make the stemmers serializable.

5. run "ant" - this will generate the jar archive in the "dist" 
   directory.


How to make the Snowball stemmers available in WEKA
---------------------------------------------------
You only need to include the generated jar "dist/snowball.jar" in your
CLASSPATH.
